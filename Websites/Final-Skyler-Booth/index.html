		<h1>Welcome to Booth Family Farms</h1>
		<p>Booth Family Farms LLC. was established in 1953 and has been a family-owned and opperated ever since.</p>
		<p>In 1953, William P. Booth (Bill) and his wife Patricia J. Booth II purchased the first plot of the current Booth Family Farms property after selling off their other 40 acre farm on the north side of Wolcottville, Indiana. The original plot of land included the farm house, which still serves as the operations base for the farm, two chicken houses, and a bank barn. Later in the 1950’s they purchased 80 acres across the road but was forced by the State of Indiana, at the time Bill Booth was an Indiana State Trooper so the State used this to their advantage, to sell so the land could be used for the Pigeon River Fish and Game Preserve. In 1964, Bill and his wife purchased his mother and father's 140 acre farm in Greenfield Township. Also in 1964, the Booths acquired 83.1 acres of farmland from Virgil L. & Madge VanDinter. On December 15, 1972 30 acres was purchased from the Estate of Mabel Phillips by her son Victor E. Phillips. In the 1980’s 18 acres was purchased by Bill &amp; Patricia and put into their three children’s names north of the Toll Road in Greenfield Township. The last piece of property was purchased May 7, 2013 from Dawn L. Melton and consisted of a house, two small barns, and 12.5 acres. The buildings were razed so an irrigation pivot could turn. This final purchase brought the farms total acreage to 326.9 acres of land not including the buildings.</p>
