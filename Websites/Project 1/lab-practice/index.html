        <p>We all recognize emoji. Theyâ€™ve become the global pop stars of digital communication. But what are they, technically speaking? And what might we learn by taking a closer look at these images, characters, pictographs... whatever they are ðŸ¤” (Thinking Face). We will dig deep to learn about how these thingamajigs work. Now, let&rsquo;s start with a seemingly simple question. What are emoji?</p>

        <h2>WHAT ARE EMOJI?</h2>
        <img src="images/emoji.png" alt="A picture of an emoji">
        <p>What we&rsquo;ll find is that they are born from, and depend on, the same technical foundation, character sets and document encoding that underlie the rest of our work as web-based designers, developers and content creators. So, we&rsquo;ll delve into these topics using emoji as motivation to explore this fundamental aspect of the web. We&rsquo;ll learn all about emoji as we go, including how we can effectively work them into our own projects, and we&rsquo;ll collect valuable resources along the way. There is a lot of misinformation about these topics online, a fact made painfully clear to me as I was writing this article. Chances are youâ€™ve encountered more than a little of it yourself. The recent release of Unicode 9 and the enormous popularity of emoji make now as good a time as any to take a moment to appreciate just how important this topic is, to look at it afresh and to fill in any gaps in our knowledge, large or small. By the end of this article, you will know [bold] everything you need to know about emoji, [end bold] regardless of the platform or application youâ€™re using, including the distributed web. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll know where to find the authoritative details to answer any emoji-related question you may have now or in the future. 21 June 2016 brought the official release of Unicode Version 9.0, and with it 72 new emoji. What are they? Where do new emoji come from anyway? Why aren&rsquo;t your friends seeing the new ROFL, Fox Face, Crossed Fingers and Pancakes emoji you&rsquo;re sending them?! ðŸ˜¡ (Pouting Face emoji) Keep reading for the answers to these and many other questions. A question to get us started: What is the plural form of the word &ldquo;emoji&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s a question that came up in the process of reviewing and editing this article. The good news is that I have an answer! The bad news (depending on how bothered you are by triviality) is that the answer is that there is no definitive answer. I believe the most accurate answer that can be given is to say that, currently, there is no established correct form for the plural of emoji. An article titled <a href=" http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/whats-the-plural-of-emoji-emojis/422763/">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Plural of Emoji?&rdquo;</a> by Robinson Meyer, published by The Atlantic on 6 January 2016, discusses exactly this issue. The author turns up recent conflicting uses of both forms &ldquo;emoji&rdquo; and &ldquo;emojis,&rdquo; even within the same national publications:</p>

            <blockquote> In written English right now, there&rsquo;s little consensus on this question. National publications have not settled on a regular style. The Atlantic, for instance, used both (emoji, emojis) in the last quarter of 2015. And in October alone in The New York Times, you could find the technology reporter Vindu Goel covering <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/technology/facebook-to-test-emoji-as-reaction-icons.html">Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;six new emoji,&rdquo;</a> despite, two weeks later, Austin Ramzy detailing the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/world/australia/australia-emoji-julie-bishop-diplomacy-vladimir-putin.html">Australian foreign minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;liberal use of emojis.&rdquo;</a> ... The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, which, as we will see, is the group responsible for emoji in the Unicode Standard, uses &ldquo;emoji&rdquo; as the plural form. This plural form appears in passages of documentation quoted in this article. Consider, for example, the very first sentence of the first paragraph of the Emoji Subcommittee&rsquo;s official homepage at unicode.org:

            </blockquote> <p>Emoji are pictographs (pictorial symbols) that are typically presented in a colorful form and used inline in text. They represent things such as faces, weather, vehicles and buildings, food and drink, animals and plants, or icons that represent emotions, feelings, or activities. I have chosen the plural &ldquo;emoji&rdquo;, for the sake of consistency if nothing else. At this point in time, you can confidently use whichever form you prefer, unless of course the organization or individual for whom you&rsquo;re writing has strong opinions one way or the other. You can and should consult your style guide if necessary. We&rsquo;ll start at the beginning, with the basic building blocks not just of emoji, nor even digital communication, but of all written language: characters and character sets.</p>
